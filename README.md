# mental-health-biomarker-relational-db
This project implements a relational clinical research database in MySQL, integrating multimodal mental health data including patient demographics, admissions, laboratory biomarkers, diagnoses, survey assessments, and neuroimaging features. Built using a subset of MIMIC-IV data with supplementary schema extensions, the system enables structured querying of biomarker–diagnosis relationships and supports scalable analytical workflows in mental health research.
